Title: Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for 'nimble'
Description: Sequential Monte Carlo methods to extend the 'nimble' modeling
    package. Includes five particle filtering algorithms for use with state space
    models: "Auxiliary", "Bootstrap", "Ensemble Kalman filter", "Iterated Filtering
    2", and "Liu-West". See the paper "Sequential Monte Carlo Methods in the
    nimble R Package" (Michaud et al. 2020) for more details. A full User Manual is
    available at <https://r-nimble.org>.
